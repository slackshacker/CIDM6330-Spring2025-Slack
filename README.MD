# A Software Solution for Program Participation Management
As the Director of Information Technology for Liberty Healthcare Corporation, I’ve seen firsthand how the inefficiencies of duplicated systems can drive up operational costs. Across our state and federal programs in mental health, developmental disabilities, and aged and disabled care, we often find ourselves managing redundant data, participant demographics, program participation, and eligibility status spread across multiple proprietary systems. Each new program or contract exacerbates this issue, increasing complexity and cost. This problem needs solving, and I believe a well-designed software system can do just that.

The domain of this challenge is deeply rooted in healthcare, specifically within U.S. programs designed to support vulnerable populations. The root of our current state has been in addressing the "we need it now" push to deliver rather than a supportable and holistic approach. These programs aim to provide adequate supportive services while achieving meaningful healthcare outcomes. However, managing program participant data across state and federal levels is no small task. It involves navigating a web of demographic records, medical histories, and eligibility criteria that can vary widely across programs. This creates significant barriers to achieving the streamlined, person-centered care that these populations deserve.

My professional interest in solving this problem stems from the operational challenges I see every day. Our reliance on multiple, overlapping systems wastes time and resources that could otherwise be devoted to improving services. I am particularly interested in exploring how we can centralize and standardize this shared dataset into a multi-tenant, extensible solution that eliminates redundancy and allows us to scale efficiently. By addressing this issue, we can reduce costs and improve data accessibility, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the people we serve.

I propose prototyping a multi-tenant participation management system to better understand the problem and the design considerations required to solve it. The goal of this prototype is to demonstrate how a single, extensible solution can effectively manage participant data while addressing the complexities of a multi-program environment. It would focus on four core functionalities:

1. **User Authentication and Role Management:** Implementing robust, multi-level access controls to ensure secure and appropriate access in a multi-tenant environment.
2. **Participant Demographics Management:** Streamlining data entry and access for key information, including contact details for participants, guardians, legal representatives, and primary physicians.
3. **Program Data Management:** Centralizing program datasets for efficient querying, updating, and reporting across multiple contracts. This data management should enable unique data for each program to enable new programs and the retirement of obsolete programs.
4. **Program Eligibility Calculation and Tracking:** Addressing unique and dynamic eligibility requirements, such as age-specific qualifications, to ensure accurate and consistent tracking of participant statuses.
	
For this prototype, I envision a web application that runs on a Windows 11 Pro desktop system. Using **.NET** or **Python** for the backend and either **React** or **Microsoft Blazor** for the frontend, the solution would align with modern industry standards while maintaining compatibility with a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approach for future deployment in cloud platforms like Azure or AWS, our current cloud providers. This setup would not only allow for efficient prototyping but also provide a strong foundation for scaling the solution into a fully operational system if pursued to the next logical steps.

The prototype’s primary goals would be to:

1. Lay the foundations to explore the requirements and design options for a multi-tenant role-based access-controlled system. I view this as one of the critical aspects of the prototype.
2. Identify challenges in centralizing and standardizing datasets across multiple programs and contracts.
3. Explore user experience and interface design to create a solution that is intuitive, person-centered, and accessible to users at all levels.
