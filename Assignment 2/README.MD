Description: 
		Creates an API using Python and FastAPI for the CIDM 6330 - Assignment 02, 
		From Specification to API Deliverables. This API is designed to support the
		course project's Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) by implementing at least
		one entity from the domain.
		
Instructor course notes on execution:
		We can use FastAPI to create a basic HTTP/RESTful API in Python.
		Assumes that the following packages have been installed useing pip:
    	1. pip install fastapi
    	2. pip install uvicorn

		Or, we can use the built-in fastapi command to run the API, but we'll need an additional package installation:
    	1. pip install "fastapi[standard]"

		Altnatively, you we can use fastapi diectly from the command line:
    	1. uvicorn main:app --reload
